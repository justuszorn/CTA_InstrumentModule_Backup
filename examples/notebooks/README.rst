Example Notebooks
=================

To view these examples, you must start up an IPython Notebook server
via the folowing command (in the current directory):

  ipython notebook

Then, you should be able to load the notebooks and execute them
interactively (push shift-enter to execute a cell)

You can also view all of the notebooks (non-interactively) via github at:
